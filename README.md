# ysph-bibliometrics
Goal: creating an easy workflow to generate good-enough, machine-actionable YSPH publication data
The output needs to allow users to see total publications, first-author publications, and last-author publications for a given YSPH author in a year.
The workflow needs to facilitate self-service.
The data quality needs to be similar to that of the Faculty Affairs Qualtrics data.
