Zoonotic spillover, which is the transmission of a pathogen from a vertebrate
animal to a human, presents a global public health burden but is a poorly
understood phenomenon. Zoonotic spillover requires several factors to align,
including the ecological, epidemiological and behavioural determinants of
pathogen exposure, and the within-human factors that affect susceptibility to
infection. In this Opinion article, we propose a synthetic framework for
animal-to-human transmission that integrates the relevant mechanisms. This
framework reveals that all zoonotic pathogens must overcome a hierarchical serie                                                                                                                                                                                               s
of barriers to cause spillover infections in humans. Understanding how these
barriers are functionally and quantitatively linked, and how they interact in
space and time, will substantially improve our ability to predict or prevent
spillover events. This work provides a foundation for transdisciplinary
investigation of spillover and synthetic theory on zoonotic transmission.
